# 🏡 Household Chatbot (Python CLI)

This is a simple command-line based **household chatbot assistant** that manages basic day-to-day tasks like reminders, shopping lists, and greetings. It's built in Python using clean modular design principles and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✨ **Natural Language Input:** Responds to user messages with greetings, task intents, and list operations.
- 📋 **Task Management:** Create, add to, delete, or display shopping and to-do lists.
- 🧾 **Intent Recognition:** Classifies user inputs into predefined intents (e.g., greeting, list operation).
- 🛠️ **Modular Design:** Separated components for NLP, intent dispatching, and list management.
